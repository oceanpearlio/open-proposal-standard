This is especially evident when you look at a subset of the Ocean ecosystem: oceanDAO.\nIt is almost impossible to keep track of all proposals, deliverables, progress, and impact on the ecosystem. Users who want to vote also need to touch several platforms to inform themselves (Github, port, vote). As a project owner, you have to write a new proposal based on a text template which is not ideal as formatting differences make it very difficult for automated software to extract the relevant information from a proposal. \nOpportunity:\nGet a (quick) overview of the projects in the Ocean ecosystem via an easy to use web app\nA community-initiated project as a foundation for a decentralized OceanDAO\nImprove transparency of (funded) projects\nCreate guidelines for (future) OceanDAO proposals for better comparability between projects/proposals\nGive more people with a non-tech background the opportunity to overview current developments.\nBuild the foundation for a place to get a high-level overview of the health and diversity of the Ocean ecosystem\nStandardized, clean data through an API for third parties \nKeep up with new proposals in the OceanDAO\nCheck if OceanDAO projects delivered what they promised\nTrack the progress of funded projects\nA quick way to find exciting projects (to contribute to)\nAggregate Ocean Protocol content into one platform\n", // [String||Markdown] How will your project provide value?

Ocean Pearl has become independent, but will continue working with the tech ship.\nAdditionally we are working closely together with the oceanDAO to align our goals to improve the general experience for everyone since the early adopters of Ocean Pearl will be the OceanDAO community.\nThe Ocean Pearl members have a strong background in web development and are dedicated to building the project for the long run.\nAfter the current MVP release we are especially working on enhancing the user experience and improving data quality.
