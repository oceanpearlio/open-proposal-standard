The proposal will be exported as [open-proposal-standard](https://github.com/oceanpearlio/open-proposal-standard) which can easily be consumed by third parties. Furthermore, we make the proposal data available via our API.\n\n### Question on \"value add\" criteria: which one or more of the criteria will your project focus on? Why do you believe your team will do well on those criteria?\n\n**This proposal is the second of a three part series** to streamline the user experience regarding proposing to the OceanDAO.\n\n\n\n1. Simplified project/proposal-creation with standardized proposal structure\n\n   - projects spend less time writing proposals and more time building\n   - lowering barriers to entry for first time projects\n\n2. Publish Proposals in a machine readable format (public access via api) \n\n   - reduce manual data extraction from proposals\n\n   - this helps to scale the internal processes of the oceanDAO\n\n   - enable other projects to exchange proposal-data in a standardized way", // [String||Markdown] Describe final product (max 4096 chars)
  "valueAdded": "While the Ocean ecosystem is growing, it is difficult to keep track of all the developments, announcements, events, and conversations. This is especially evident when you look at a subset of the Ocean ecosystem: oceanDAO.\nIt is almost impossible to keep track of all proposals, deliverables, progress, and impact on the ecosystem. Users who want to vote also need to touch several platforms to inform themselves (Github, port, vote). As a project owner, you have to write a new proposal based on a text template which is not ideal as formatting differences make it very difficult for automated software to extract the relevant information from a proposal. \nOpportunity:\nGet a (quick) overview of the projects in the Ocean ecosystem via an easy to use web app\nA community-initiated project as a foundation for a decentralized OceanDAO\nImprove transparency of (funded) projects\nCreate guidelines for (future) OceanDAO proposals for better comparability between projects/proposals\nGive more people with a non-tech background the opportunity to overview current developments.\nBuild the foundation for a place to get a high-level overview of the health and diversity of the Ocean ecosystem\nStandardized, clean data through an API for third parties \nKeep up with new proposals in the OceanDAO\nCheck if OceanDAO projects delivered what they promised\nTrack the progress of funded projects\nA quick way to find exciting projects (to contribute to)\nAggregate Ocean Protocol content into one platform\n", // [String||Markdown] How will your project provide value?

This will drive automation, scaling and will enable other projects to use the data. We want to improve the user experience for proposal creators. For this reason, we have created extensive [figma designs](https://www.figma.com/file/7dtPoxdTarwvlPXOPPg4UO/?node-id=2146%3A587) that will be implemented as part of this proposal.\n\nOceanDAO is currently evaluating Gitcoin as a full-fledged solution for proposal handling. If Gitcoin becomes the underlying system behind OceanDAO, Ocean Pearl will seek to adapt to it and integrate the proposal creation process into it. If Gitcoin proves to be an insufficient solution, Ocean Pearl's Proposal Creator could serve as a standalone alternative.\n\nPart of this proposal is retroactive funding for changes to the leaderboard. Due to a change in the funding mechanism, unused tokens are no longer burned. This led to incorrect calculations in our leaderboard. This required major changes to our backend system.\n", // [String||Markdown] Detailed description (max chars 4096 chars)
